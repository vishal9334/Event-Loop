what is event loop ? and with diagram.

JavaScript is a singal thread language not a multi thread language.
Still this language has Asynchronous(async) and Non -blocking behaviour.This term are totally different are from multi thread.
Please don't mixUp both behaviour.How is this behaviour ?
This behaviour comes through the Api of our web browser and Node js like the fetch 
Api which is not available by default in JavaScript.Is only avilable on web Api & Node js.
Like in which fetch Api is not available by default in js. Is available on Web Api & Node Js.
Both of them have capebilites and has been mimicked by the run time, that is it has been copied.
Like Node, Bun, Deno these are environment are give some option provide for DOM Api, HTTP Request.
DOM Api, HTTP Request both of these behaviour are asynchronous and non-blocking, hence the entire
incident is called an event loop.
